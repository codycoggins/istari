# App Improvement ideas

List maintained by Cody.  These are ideas that have not yet been designed or planned.


## UI
- Add a button by todos that says "context".  It should display relevant info for 
- Allow TODOs to be tagged
- Light and dark mode.
- Make the size of the right hand TASKS panel adjustable.  User can adjust by dragging the border. Make the default size wider than it is now.

## Backend
- When referring to emails or web pages or file system documents or calendar entries, include a hyperlink in the response. (note: right now when I ask for links it shows them in markdown format, which is a great start but the front end doesn't render markdown.)
- What is current database location- executable and database files
- Database backup strategy

More logging.  Areas of interest:
- Privacy - log when using a local model

## Data Sources

- Google Drive
- Obsidian?  (it is duplicative of file system)

work - more difficult
- Jira??
- Outlook??
- GitHub??

## Mobile
- Add a messaging app so I can reach Istari on mobile.

## Model

Concept of "projects". TODOs and knowledge can be associated with projects.  Projects can have urgency/importance like tasks.

## Misc

- MyPy github actions check is not passing

## DONE

- Completed TODOs: display them crossed out until midnight. Don't display tasks completed before today.  Keep them in database for reference.
- Display attributes with todos in a compact way (icons?) - in progress, trying eisenhour badges2
- Add a favicon.ico - DONE
- Some of the UI doesn't have enough contrast.
